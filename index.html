            bad treatment of orphans in workhouse
        </h3>
        <h5 class="card-title" style="text-align:justify">
            Oliver Twist, is the story of an orphan set in the Victorian era.<br>
            The novel was written by Charles Dickens and published in 1837.<br>
            The story begins with a woman who takes refuge in a workhouse to give birth, but unfortunately she dies during childbirth and her ring and pendant are stolen by old Sally.<br>
            This child is our protagonist.<br>
            Oliver's early life was characterized by constant abuse, the orphans did not receive enough food and so they chose among themselves to ask for an extra portion of food.<br>
            The managers of the workhouse placed him in isolation and gave him up for adoption as an apprentice.<br>
            From here on, Oliver goes on many adventures and meets many people, among whom he finds his father from whom he inherits a large inheritance.<br>
            Charles Dickens in this work analyzes the exploitation and bad treatment that the poor but especially the orphans had to suffer in the workhouses.<br>
            In 1834, the Poor Law (Amendment) Act established the workhouse system.<br>
            Instead of providing shelter for the elderly, the sick, and the poor, and instead of providing food or clothing in exchange for work in times of high unemployment, workhouses were to become a kind of prison system.<br>
            The government's intention was to cut spending on poverty by establishing a cruelly deterrent regime.<br>
            and only inside the workhouse (which meant entering it to live, full time) in exchange for a meager subsistence. Homes were divided, possessions sold, families separated.Charles Dickens in this work analyzes the exploitation and bad treatment that the poor but especially the orphans had to suffer in the workhouses.<br>
            The old parish hospices and hospices had to be completely transformed, from that moment on no cash support would be distributed - whatever the difficulty or the season - and the ancient gifts in kind (food, shoes, blankets) that could help a family to survive together, now they were not allowed.<br>
            The only option would be hard work, forced labor,<br>
            and only inside the workhouse (which meant entering it to live, full time) in exchange for a meager subsistence. Homes were divided, possessions sold, families separated.<br>
            Charles Dickens was very interested in this topic because as a child he too was forced into these Workhouses because his father had been arrested for gambling debts.<br>

            industrial working class
            - ⁠gap between social classes 
            - ⁠discrimination in education
        </h3>
        <h5 class="card-title" style="text-align:justify">
            David Copperfield is a novel written by Charles Dickens, first published between 1849 and 1850.<br>
            It is considered one of the author's masterpieces and one of the most autobiographical works of English literature.<br>
            The novel tells the story of David Copperfield, a young orphan who tries to realise his dreams at a time of great social and economic transformation caused by the Industrial Revolution.<br>
            One of the main themes of the novel is social inequality between different classes of people, which is also reflected in discrimination in education.<br>
            David Copperfield lives his childhood and adolescence in conditions of poverty and exploitation, working as a blacksmith, as a clerk and as a teacher.<br>
            He has no access to adequate education and faces many difficulties in obtaining a professional qualification.<br>
            Even when he manages to get into Oxford, the prestigious English university, he has to suffer injustice and bullying from his richer and more privileged peers.<br>
            Another important theme of the novel is the search for one's identity and destiny.<br>
            David Copperfield has to face many changes in his life, including his marriage to Agnes Wickfield, the birth of his children, his relationship with Uriah Heep, his success as a writer and his love for Dora Spenlow.<br>
            The novel shows how David is able to overcome adversity and find happiness through his strength of spirit, generosity and faith.<br>
            David Copperfield is a very interesting novel to read because it offers a historical and social view of 19th century England, but also a personal and emotional story of a protagonist searching for his place in the world.<br>

            treatment of the working class
        </h3>
        <h5 class="card-title" style="text-align:justify">
            "Hard Times" is a novel written by Charles Dickens and published in 1854. Set in the industrial town of Coketown, the book critically explores the treatment of the working class during the Victorian era.<br>
            In the novel, Dickens highlights the dehumanizing consequences of industrialization on people's lives, emphasizing the lack of empathy and the rigidity of social institutions.<br>
            The plot revolves around the Gradgrind family, representing the utilitarian and rationalistic mindset of the time.<br>
            The working class is portrayed as victims of oppressive working conditions and a lack of social support. Characters like Stephen Blackpool, a textile worker, are trapped in cycles of poverty and exploitation.<br>
            Dickens also criticizes education that emphasizes only useful facts, neglecting the human and creative aspects of life.<br>
            Through "Hard Times," Dickens aims to raise awareness about social injustices and promote greater compassion and understanding toward the working class.<br>
            The novel is a powerful commentary on the need for social equity in an era of rapid industrial change.<br>

            The treatment of crime and justice in Great Expectations
        </h3>
        <h5 class="card-title" style="text-align:justify">
            Dickens presents his view of a harsh legal system because his father was imprisoned when he was a boy.<br>
            This could have biased his View against the legal system. Also, when becoming a journalist Dickens was a court reporter and Dickens became tired of the limitations of the legal system.<br>
            The most popular form of justice for a crime to the legal system was execution.<br>
            The executions were held publicly and this meant the general population were accustomed to death.<br>
            This made the legal system was seen as an entertainment. Another way of showing this is the two heads that are in Jaggers’ office.<br>
            They are seen as his two most famous clients.<br>
            The fact of him having them on display means that the law side is a sideshow to the spectacle that crime and executions provide.<br>
            As many people were poorly educated, they had no idea if the legal system was correct.<br>
            So, they did not question the ideas of those who were in a higher standing in society.<br>
            Dickens presents a view of how suspected criminals are treated by the justice system as unduly harsh, corrupt and unfair.<br>
            This view is most obviously shown in the two trials. The first trial is when Magwitch and Compeyson are tried together.<br>
